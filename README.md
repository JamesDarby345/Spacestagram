# Spacestagram

The app is deployed with Heroku at: https://spacestagram-application.herokuapp.com/
Note: Heroku will put the site to sleep after it hasnt been used for ~30 minutes,
this causes it to take about ~15 seconds to boot up again.

The client and server folders contain the source code for the project.
The src folder contains the built code for deployment, not meant to be human readable.
